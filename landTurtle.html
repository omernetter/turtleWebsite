    <p>Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a shell developed mainly
         from their ribs. </p>
    <p>Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the side-necked turtles and hidden neck 
        turtles which differ in the way the head retracts. </p>
    <p>There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including tortoises and 
        terrapins. </p>
